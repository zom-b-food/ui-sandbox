          <h2>Healthy Painting, LLC; “For the Health of Your Home, Family & Business”</h2>
          <h3>How it all started:</h3>
          <p>As a teen, I began working around the neighborhood just outside of Cleveland, Ohio. What began as handing out flyers for mowing lawns and raking leaves, eventually turned into painting homes and garages in 1978. </p>
          <h3>Who I Learned From:</h3>
          <p>In 1980, I spent a year in the California Conservation core as an 18 year old. This was my initial introduction to the world of conservation, and all of its possibilities. Although it has been many years, I am glad to have been a part of the ideology and lifestyle of conservation and environmental concerns at such an impressionable age. It is a great feeling to know that my life is more consistent to what I believed and was exposed to way back then. </p>
          <p>In 1981 I met with a local contractor, J & J Painting, and began working full time as a contractor's apprentice. This was the beginning of many gifts that I would receive that lead to the commitment of quality, integrity, and the experience our company has today. J & J Painting was a partnership that had already existed for 20 years. The more experienced of the two had a father that had been a painter, contracting for 25 years prior, and sharing his experience with the company. </p>
          <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
          <p>The guidance and insight was invaluable, and where I would gain the understanding that every job, (be it a rental apartment or a custom home in an affluent neighborhood) deserved equally thorough attention and quality, from the preparation to the painting. </p>
          <h3>Changing Trends and Technology:</h3>
          <p>Having been involved in the same career for three decades has afforded me the opportunity to witness and take part in many changes in the field. </p>
          <p>It is interesting to look back so many years and remember where everything was, what everything was becoming, and where things were moving to at that time: </p>
          <p>Thirty years ago, there were generally about a dozen choices for interior paint colors, and probably even less for exterior paints. There was likely just over a handful of companies producing paints in any given area and certainly a lot less in small towns. Contractors had just begun transitioning from custom tinting their paints, with tubes of leaded paint, to having the paint suppliers tint it. </p>
          <p>The lack of technology and experience created the wasting of a lot of paint. Less than 50% of color matching’s were successful. If you didn’t get what you needed in the beginning it was quite a heartbreaking experience, going back for more. </p>
          <p>Although the West Coast had already begun setting standards for the industry regarding the use of oil paints, air quality and product ingredients, the Midwest was holding on strong to its old fashioned ideas. To this day, they are still battling the challenges and the repercussions of the years of lead paint use in the inner city of Cleveland, Ohio. </p>
          <p>Being someone that to this day still does most of their work by hand (brush and roller), and watching the trends switch to spray paint technology was quite the sight. As was  seeing the trends going from paint to wallpaper to painting again, to putting wallpaper back up, as well as seeing the change bounce back and forth between painting the woodwork to stripping it back to its original finish, the light wood or the dark wood. </p>
          <p>The severe Midwestern weather reaped quite a bit of havoc on the exterior of the 100 year old homes that were often neglected longer than was ideal. What was ideal about this from a standpoint of my own experience and commitment to quality was that which I gained from working on these difficult and challenging projects on a regular basis. </p>
          <p>As an alternative to all the time and labor spent on thoroughly scraping, sanding, priming and preparing the exterior surfaces of a home, the industry came up with sand blasting. This was a period of time that companies were literally sandblasting the paint off of homes and taking it down to the bare wood. In theory it sounded ideal, but it often ruined the structural and visual integrity of the wood and eventually became illegal on account of all the damage it did, not only to the house, but the neighboring homes, cars and the like. Environmentally it left the land our children played on filled with lead. </p>
          <h3>Our Philosophy and the Process that Separates Us:</h3>
          <p>Let's face it; painting is a very easy field to get in to. There are no real educational requirements (unfortunately), and with or without the means to do it legally, it is simply a matter of going to any number of stores, and spending a relatively small amount of money to purchase the things that would make it possible to perform a majority of the most requested services in the field. </p>
          <p>Labor & Industries is relentless in its effort to find those that are operating outside the boundaries of legitimacy, yet there is always a market for someone who can do it faster, cheaper and with less of the red tape involved in working with legally formed and operating businesses. </p>
          <p>Many of those operating under this structure can offer quality services and do so safely and efficiently. The challenge is with those that do not have the experience, do not deliver a quality product, and can not do so in a safe manner. The sum of such experiences delivers negative repercussions to a number of legitimate people and places, unfairly. </p>
          <p>As the company owner, my 31 years of experience is not something that many people can lay claim to, nor is it anything that I take lightly. </p>
          <p>It is safe to say that almost all exterior painting, and more and more interior, is now done by method of spraying. We are one of the very few companies that continue to do a majority of its exterior work and all of its interior work by the old craft method of brushing and rolling. </p>
          <p>Most will claim that spraying is as good if not better and claim they also “back brush” and “back roll”. If done at all, it is often just sliding over the surface of the area that has been sprayed. </p>
          <p>One of the arguments we have against it is that spraying is more of a surface application. Brushing and rolling methods, which pushes the product deeper into the grain of the material and creates a seal, has more bonding strength and longevity. Most companies claim to back brush or back roll the paint, but they are more often just sliding the paint over the sprayed surface. This helps create a seal but does not bond well. </p>
          <p>Another opposition we have is the incredible amount of plastic that is used to battle the over spray, then rolled up and tossed into our waste stream. More paint is generally used on account of the percentage that ends up in the air, on the tarps, or the ground. </p>
          <p> In reality, the main reason contractors have gone to spray equipment is the fact that it is cheap and easy. They can make the most profit by giving an inadequate product in less time with less labor. </p>
          <p>One of the areas of interior and exterior painting and painting related services that is generally less favored is working on old or older homes and buildings. The projects demand a much greater amount of time, energy and effort. We love the look, feel, and character of old homes! Many people wait too long to do the work and it is no longer a paint job – the integrity of a structure can often be compromised long before it shows the signs </p>
          <p>It is very common to have exterior siding torn off, interior trim torn out, and walls torn down or covered over with something new. There is no problem with this, if that’s what the customer wants however, we prefer to restore the natural beauty of an old structure. Remodeling tends to be very expensive and most importantly change the original look, feel, and energy of the home. Duplicates of the original materials can usually be found at several of the companies that recycle these things from homes, but the cost is often extremely high. </p>
          <p>The effort and willingness, along with the right knowledge and experience, can often turn the most seemingly hopeless projects into those that wind up being the most beautiful, without compromising the original vision of the original builders and designers. At times it may be merely a matter of a little bit of extra cleaning, sanding, scraping, caulking, primer and plaster. </p>
          <p>One of our overall general beliefs is that regardless of the project, it is imperative that plenty of time and focus need be spent on the set-up and preparation. We understand that it is every bit as important to the look of the final outcome of the project as the painting itself. </p>
          <h3>Environmental Responsibility:</h3>
          <p>A recent report has stated that 98% of products claimed green are misleading. This may lead us to believe that there must be some reason that so many are trying to find a space in this so called “market”. The choices vary as much as the opinions about its actual need. </p>
          <p>As a company, we choose to be convinced of its need and are committed to implementing it as fully in to our operation as we are able, as well as to take time to learning and educating others. The “green”, “Eco”, etc. mindset has been a topic of conversation in our society for decades (it's safe to say that it's been around forever) and is simultaneously so very new. </p>
          <p>For myself personally it has been an incredible transition to both view and to be a part of. Starting out at a time, and in a part of the country where lifestyles and everyday actions were at their most toxic, to now see, hear, and feel such a drastic change in the whole energy of everything, is very exciting. When I left the inner city of Ohio in 2002, it was still possible to put most anything imaginable out by the curb to be picked up and thrown in the landfills (and that was literally “anything”). </p>
          <p>Long-term product exposure in our field has long been known to be one of the worst. It would be misleading for us to say we know everything there is to know about our practices, but each day and each project brings us a little closer to that place. </p>
          <p>Although, not as many as might be expected, there are now more and more painting companies acknowledging themselves as being “green”. It's really great to see the shift. There is however, more to being environmentally responsible than merely being conscious of the idea. Just picking up a can of paint at a chain store, that has the words “Eco” on it, is a great place to begin yet opens itself up to so much more. </p>
          <p>We are doing our best to put our words and intentions into action. We have spoken directly with all the manufactures about their products ingredients as well as to the deeper philosophies and commitments of the companies. We have spoken with the Hazardous Waste Management Division about the proper way to recycle and dispose of the refuse and unused components of our industry. We have spoken with The American Lung Association about materials and methods of operation that create the least amount of threat to someone’s health and to their well being. </p>
          <p>We continue to set up opportunities to learn about what can be done, the best way to do it, and to share that information with others. As the owner, I am stepping out from my life long, full time position behind the paintbrush and becoming an educator and an advocate to the average do-it-yourself homeowner by putting together a program for our local communities and neighborhoods. </p>
          <p>It’s about so much more than just the paint; it's the cleaners, the Spackle, the caulking, the brushes, the manner in which you clean and store the equipment, the manner in which you dispose of the refuse, the amount of unnecessary waste that is created on a project, the knowing not to buy more material than you need. The areas in which one can take on a level of responsibility are limitless. </p>
          <p>I had always wanted to be a contributor and participator of life, yet was always looking to do it in other areas of my life. I did not truly understand that I could do it in my painting career, up until the last 4 years. </p>
          <p>The service we offer is not reserved strictly to those that share our philosophies and mindset yet is ideal for those who are. </p>
          <p>As we began transitioning several years ago, we had been willing to make exceptions regarding the materials we used on our projects. We now stand firm with our decision to only use the best materials and perform the required tasks in a manner that is consistent with our full commitment to quality, health, safety, environmental, and social responsibility. </p>
          <h3>Vendors, Manufacturers, and Products: </h3>
          <p>There are a countless numbers of resources for acquiring paint and painting related materials. As wide as the variety of choices as there are available, so too are the variances in quality and price. Of course, everyone claims to have the best paint, but that is obviously not possible. </p>
          <p>Knowing which products are best for a project is something that requires more than the promises and price breaks that many vendors offer to contractors. Many of these vendors are trained to sell paint and are often without any experience as painters. </p>
          <p>Even the best paints and products stand inferior without the proper conditions, preparation, and application. </p>
          <p>All of the products that we use have been researched thoroughly; from meeting with the manufactures to the more important use on our projects. We hold no stake in, or allegiance to any product or manufacturer. We have an open mind to change and the possibility that what once may have been, may not be so now. Companies do change ownership, their formulas, and quality; yet manage to keep the same name. </p>
          <p>We do not make our decisions about which products to use on our projects, simply on basis of price or ease of availability and we are not afraid to challenge the vendors and manufactures in the interest of the highest and best good of the product, our client and the environment. </p>
          <p>All of our products meet the highest and most complete level of required testing and warranty and many of our most used products posses the green seal of certification. </p>
          <h3>Prices:</h3>
          <p> We are high-end painters and are best suited for clients that are looking for the highest level of experience, quality, and guarantee available. We apply a high-quality design-oriented palette to your interior and exterior living spaces that provide a beautiful base for your individual and personal creative spark. </p>
          <p>This does not automatically assume that we will not be more expensive, or that a project done by us would even cost any more than might be expected, but in general terms; “if you want it done cheap, then we may not be the right fit for you”. </p>
          <p>Upon meeting with a number of contractors, that we consider to be on an equal level of quality and price, we know that our prices are fair and competitive. </p>
          <h3>Time Lines:</h3>
          <p>We indicate the speculated time for completion on all of our proposals; in order to give you some general indication. </p>
          <p>We share with our clients the idea that our company is smaller than some of those with large crews, or multiple crews that work on several projects simultaneously. We point out, being convinced that we afford more attention than most, to our preparation as well to the thoroughness and completeness of the overall project. </p>
          <p>This does not automatically assume that we will not be efficient, or that a project done by us would even take any longer than might be expected. </p>
          <h3>Operating Our Business Legally:</h3>
          <p>Painting and Contracting work is relatively easy for anyone to get in, with or without the honest ability to back up the claim. </p>
          <p>Due to a variety of reasons, there are many that operate under the guise of professionalism, without being legally compliant to license, bond, and insurance. </p>
          <p>Insurance and bonds are high on the account of many as to the liabilities created by uninsured contractors. Also for those with insurance that do not have the training, experience, and commitment for care that is needed to operate a safe and equally productive work site. </p>
          <p>The reputations of compliant contractors are marred and cases turn into unpleasant legal battles when someone is injured on the job, within a business that had not been functioning legitimately under the legal requirements. </p>
